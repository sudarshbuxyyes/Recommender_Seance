# Recommender_Seance
Built a Recommender System for my DBMS Project using User-Based Collaborative Filtering.

The Recommender System uses the previously watched and starred shows, anime, movies and their ratings to provide recommendations for each user using a slightly tweaked version of a neighbourhood-based recommendation model.
Built for Seance App (DBMS Project) using Java, Apache Mahout.
